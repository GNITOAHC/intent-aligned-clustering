0,can any one.....................? tell me wat is the biggest fright you eva got seeing u in the morning hhhhhh im kidding u look sweet from ur name ;-)\n\nfor me sometimes its dark and graves in the night
1,"How will you meet the love of your life? My scenario: \nI will meet them probably at some bad social function/occasion i'm forced to go too. I'll be in the back by the punch bowl. The love of my life will be like ""this really sucks, I was dragged to this.."" ""I'd be like yeah..this sucks.."" We'll both be really cynical and antisocial. It will be fate. IM SURE IT WILL BE SOME1 THAT IM FIGHTING WITH FOR W/E REASON,IM A FIESTY MAMA! LOL I LIKE SOME1 TO CHALLENGE ME,THAT INTRIGUES ME,ESP IF THEY CAN PROVE THEIR POINT,TO WHERE IM LOST FOR WORDS,THAT WILL BE HIM! LOL CRAZY HUH?"
2,"I kissed my boyfriend at school. I came home to re-imagine it. I closed my eyes and saw me kissing another guy This is not the first time I re-imagined me and my boyfriend kiss, but it's the first time that I went to do it and another guy came up as him. What can possible be making these allusions? You're going insane...?"
3,"Ladies, choose one - Mr. Sex or Mr. Nice Guy? Ladies, just trying to figure out what's really important to you. Which guy would you have (cant have both) forever? Choose between the guys described below:\n\nMr. Sex - This guys knows how to do you right and is exciting, adventurous and handsome. He's the best you have ever bedded. He doesn't have a steady job, you suspect he cheats on you, he's not into the 'mushy stuff' like buying you flowers. \n\nMr. Nice Guy - This guy is the nicest person you know, treats you like a lady, remembers your birthday, genuinely cares for you and will make a good responsible father. He has a good 8 to 5 office job. He's also not good in bed at all (cant take u to orgasm except by cunniligu.s.), he's too ""goody goody"" and generally not 'manly' in the traditional sense. \n\nChoose one of the guys and explain why Neither!!!! Maybe that's why I am still single, but I am waiting for the guy that is nice and can rock my world. Settling for Mr. Sex can lead to heartache and Mr. Nice guy probably gets a lot of girls married but it's probably why there is so much cheating going on. Women settle then can't contain themselves when the one they should have waited for comes along. I also think this is why women get accused of being much less interested in sex than their husbands. They settle for Mr. Nice guy but the sex sucks so it's ""honey I got a headache"" when it comes to booty time. I rather be alone than in bad (Mr. sex) or lousy (Mr. Nice guy) company."

Any one willing to help? do you have your biological mother's full name and possibly her address? maybe you can get information like these first, then probably try to get her number of her friends' or relatives' numbers.\n\ni think you should approach radio stations or any organization who does public services.\n\nor if you could be bolder or braver, and would want to go more public, you can contact maury povich, so you can be on his show. i've watched some people looking for their biological parent/s there and he was able to help some of them. if you're interested on this, you can go to his website: http://www.mauryshow.com/\n\ngood luck. i hope you'll find your mother."
6,"I was just trying to be honest with him...How do I get him back?? AFTER 6 MONTHS OF US BEING TOGETHER I FOUND OUT THAT FOR THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE TOGETHER HE WAS STILL WITH HIS EX. OF COURSE I GOT REALLY UPSET SO I BROKE UP WITH HIM. ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AND I STARTED TALKING AND AFTER THAT WE KIND OF DEVELOPED A ""RELATIONSHIP"" BUT TO ME IT WASNT SERIOUS AT ALL BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON WHY I EVEN STARED TALKING TO HIM WAS BECAUSE I WAS HURT ABOUT MY EX AT THE TIME HAD ""CHEATED"" ON ME. WE EVENTUALLY GOT BACK TOGETHER AND I DECIDED TO TELL HIM ABOUT ME N HIS FRIEND. HE TOOK IT EXTREMELY OUT OF PROPORTION AND BROKE UP WITH ME. A YEAR AND 1/2 OF ME N HIM WAS ALL THROWN AWAY BECAUSE I DECIDED TO BE HONEST WITH HIM. WHAT SHOULD I DO I LOVE HIM AND I KNOW HW STILL LOVES ME BUT HE SAID THAT HE DOESNT THINK ANYTHING CAN MAKE UP FOR WHAT I DID. WHEN IN REALITY I DIDNT REALLY DO ANYTHING...KIND OF. OH YEAH AND HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT BUT I MISSED HIS CALL AND WHEN I CALLED BACK HE IGNORED IT. I NEED HELP ASAP!! Ok...this sounds like the same stuff that I have went through before..Bottom line is ..it was ok as far as he was concerned to do what he did..but when you got him back and was honest he had a problem with it...Girl..Im glad to hear you did this to him. He is a jerk that thinks its ok for men to just f around on women but you showed his a s s didnt you..YOU GO GIRL!! I know you still care for him and thats normal...Just stay cool..he will come around..but in the meantime talk to as many guys as u can..."
7,"Who would u perfer having sex with Hillary Duff or Brittany Spears? Yuck. Neither. Britney Spears was hot a few years ago, but definitely not now. And I've never seen the appeal in Hillary Duff."
8,"If ur boyfriend of  5yrs found out u cheated on him&stayed w/u,is it ok for him to always use it against u? This happened almost 3yrs. ago. & After he found out,he wanted to stay with me. We are still together now,but he uses it against me all the time. Any time we have an argument,he throws it in my face. It doesn't matter if he is right or wrong,when it comes down to it everything is my fault because of what I did. Shouldn't he leave if he isn't happy? I can understand how he would feel hurt and angry towards you, however, since he chose to stay with you after finding out, he needs to come to terms with his feelings.  If he can't then he's not being fair to you or to himself.  He either needs to let it go, or if he can not, then he needs to let you go."
9,"Do guys in general NOT like girls who are ""plain"" ? I'm a girl who is shy (not as shy as I was in hs but I can approach strangers & ask them Qs... depends on what the Q is, like today I was asking peeps if they wanted to buy a ticket for Countryfest) & I sometimes dress plain & don't really do anything fancy w/ my hair. I don't have many friends & when I go to the bar I go to visit my friend Chris who works there. How many guys actually care bout personality ? Some have said that I could have my pick of any guy... but since I'm very picky there aren't a whole lot to choose fr anywayz. I don't smoke, drink or do drugs. A lot of peeps who I know do @ least one of those things. And why are guys so in to looks ? I'm skinny but ""plain."" You're exhibiting the lack of the #1 quality that us men devour; confidence.  It's hard being a woman I would imagine when you're constantly bombarded with what society thinks is attractive and desirable; and even that changes year-to-year so even Eva Longoria will be plain in a couple of years.\n\nConfidence does not come with make-up, clothing, or other earthy trappings.  It's something you build up over time when you get to understand who you are.\n\nThe quickest path to getting confidence is to stop wasting energy on what the world thinks of you and spend time on caring about what you think of you.  Once you love yourself, it will exude in a way that convinces other people they should be confident about you as well."

14,"Love Problems? i am in love with one of my friend she is amazing and i know that i love her my problem is that she was the fiance of my best friend who died in march. i promised him that i would look after her and help her but now i'm finding myself loving her. i don't know what to do on the one hand i love her and on the other i don't want to lose her as a friend \n\ni haven't spoken to my friend about my feelings i see her every weekend and we always have a great time together. What's happening seems natural. \nSince you told your friend that you would take care of her, you have to really carefully analyze whether what you feel could last forever, or whether it's just passion, as if it were just a momentary desire for her, you would break the promise made to your friend. \nI think that, if you really love her, and want to spend your time with her, there is nothing wrong, and nothing that interferes with the promise made to your friend. \nThe next step is the difficult one, which is bringing the subject up to her and having her feel the same for you. \nIf you have been getting together very often she probably will end up sharing your feelings, and wanting to be with you in a more complete way. You have to be very sensitive, though: if you friend died only this march, she's probably not at all ready to take on another relationship. Even if she thought she were, it could be an illusion, or just a desire to be fine again. \nPeople need some time to fully recover from shocks as the death of someone loved, and don't get back to their normal selves (although they sometimes are not really aware of this) until some time has gone by. \nGive things time, and take them with a lot of patience: always show her your love, but don't ask her to love you back until she's ready, and don't bring the issue up until she shows you some hints pointing at her love for you.\nGood luck, and best wishes."
15,"Why is my exs ex best friend still trying to get with me? Ok so over the long weekend me and my exs at the time best friend did stuff and my ex found out about it and was mad at us both and then yesterday my ex told me she wanted to fix things between us. I asked her why did she give me another chance and not her friend and she told me to leave it and be happy. So today her ex best friend starts hitting on me again telling me how she always wanted and stuff. I dont get caz two months ago she was calling me names and saying she wasnt impressed with me. So why now, why the changed in attitdue about me? Why is she trying to get me to be her bf? What should I do? she's desperate"
16,"why do men cheat then have the audacity to lie about it to your face? (*) Because men are cowards.  We would rather cut off our right arm than admit we don't or no longer love you.\n(*) Because men (and women) have this stupid thing called pride, and it gets in the way.  'Pride cometh before a fall.'\n(*) Because men really hate to admin they are wrong, even when they know they are wrong.  Even when they know you know they are wrong.  Think: getting lost and asking for directions.  It's normally the girl who asks, right?\n(*) Because they (mistakenly) believe the lie will cause you less pain than the (whole / half) truth.\n\nShould you wish to discuss specifics, get back to me, as I've just been there, and might be able to relate."

Well i hav seen in lot of cases that a boy and a girl used to be friends but ended somthing else Well i mean one of them will used to hav somthingelse other than friendship in their mind?? Well i also have seen this kind of thing happening. But everyone has their own way. One can hav something else in their mind but that doesnt mean that boyz and galz cant be friends.
18,"Denying without being a jerk? Ok so I'm getting the hint that my relationship with my ex is never going to work. It's all one sided (she does whatever she wants, if I bring up the past it's blown out of proportion but if she does it's fine, hangs up on me expecting me to call back and etc.) I'm a sweetheart and I've had a hot 38 year old tell me this that I'm a hottie and I have a great personality. Thankfully my ex moved out of state so I don't have to run into her, but my question is. When I date another girl and she finds out, how do I tell her that I don't want to be with her without sounding like an a55? She wants me to be one and gets me to the point where I am so she has some leverage in an argument. How do I just rid of her? I want to move away so when she does come back she'll never find me. This is a situation of be who you were or stay out of my life for good. Any suggestions. I don't want to be looked at as someone I'm not. How old are you?\nIf you don't want to be looked at as someone you're not then you better start figuring out who you are! It's easy to tell that you have no clue. If you did you wouldn't be wanting to run from this situation. \nYour priority right now should be to focus on just that-- finding out who you are. Naturally this takes years and years, but you can jump start this by:\nConcentrating on improving your health, body, mind, spirit, and soul.\nGet a better education\nVolunteer and help those less fortunate than you are\nTake some ""fun"" classes\nRead some self help books\nKeep a journal\nPray daily\nLearn to be more musical\nWrite about fifty essays beginning with the words ""I believe...""\nSpice up your social life by getting involved in some new activities or clubs (not party clubs-- clubs that promote growth and learning) \nJoin a yoga class.\nMeditate daily.\nWrite a list of the principles you call your own and hold most dear\nStart a new exercise\nConcentrate on learning and loving YOU for now.\n\nAnd about the ex:\nIf you have kids together your s.o.l. You are stuck together for life to one degree or another unless-- God forbid-- something happen to the kid(s).\nIf you don't have kids together then just grab hold of... your courage... and tell the lady you are moving on. Tell her you tried. It didn't work. You see now that it will not work. You do not need her drama games. You are going to stop contacting her. You want her to stop contacting you. And you should both move on with your lives and (eventually) see other people.\nBut be sure this is what you want before you do it!\nHave you guys tried counseling? \nP.S: Don't date the 38 year old... Why?\n1. It's TOO SOON!\n2. She's an opportunist and probably a barracuda (gold digger/clingy emotional drama game player and general sucker of men's time/money/etc.)\n3. Any 38 year old that tells you you're a ""hottie"" is trying too hard to be ""hip"".\nP.P.S: Don't date ""girls"". \nDon't date ANYONE until you stop calling grown women ""girls""."
19,"If you have a co-worker...? If you have a co-worker that is just drop dead gorgeous.  If you were able to sleep with them would you?

Anyway, recently (after 2 years) I caled her to say bye, cause she was goin to africa for a mont, 'n I figured I said a bunch of stupid stuf like ""I'm just caling to say by, hav fun etc."" so I caled again (she was EXTRMELY NERVUS, which kinda shoked me) so I said stuf that was even more stupid ""why are you even goin to africa"" ""**** about her friend"" ""sounds pretty cool"" 'n then I wait 10 seconds 'n say ""I gues that's all"" like..completely IDIOT right? So recently she returned 'n now she's not lookin at me anymore,I realy mis it :( 'n stuf So I play smooth 'n get her to smile 'n give her a chance to look at me, but whenever I look back she insatly looks away! (not like before) Then to mes things up more I asked her out.Now she is mor scared so I caled again ""sory etc."" Now What? sounds like shes a little shy too and maybe even likes u...i was shy so i know i could never talk to a guy easily...instead of trying so hard to ask her out or let her know u like her, just try doing things u both like and u will feel more comfortable talking with each other...but i do know that if u both continue being too shy to talk or express ur feelings then u will not go anywhere...good luck...:)"
21,"does he like me or not?? ok we were in class and he was butt-butting me in a game (that wasnt needed) then at a FFA convention he was asking me if I could see his nipple through his shirt...and he was nervous about doing it because his friend had to push him closer to me and he said ""just ask her dude"" and then he asked me if i could see his nipple and i said i don't know...but then he deleted me on yahoo messenger\ni think he likes me but doesnt want to talk to me when we are alone but likes to talk to me when we are in a group of people what do u think??

Anybody got any ideas? It's never easy to break ties, of any kind. if you can find the strength, you owe it to yourself not date anyone right away after breaking it off with your current beau. This month's National geographic has a great article on the chemistry of love... and love really does mar our ability to think clearly. If, after spending some time ""alone"", this new person still seems attractive, then date him. If you can, please be as clear as possible with this current beau. ""I think you're a very lovable man with great qualities, but I need to be by myself for a while, to not date anyone.

33,Why not meet a mate at church - they will be a better life partner? It doesnt matter there are bad seeds everywhere you just have to be careful. I think someone in the church could be great only because infidelity is such a sin but just because they are in the church it doesnt mean that they will follow the rules. People are just people church or no church. Good Luck in your search.

Gosh, I wish I had a man like you! Well, I say just go for it as you have been doing, but don't stop when she says to do so. If it does feel too good, as I know it does, and you are enjoying doing that, she will eventually let up.

47,"If men are scared of marriage, why are most divorces filed by women? Most stats I've seen indicate that 70-75% of divorces are filed by women.\n\nI've also seen stats that put infidelity by men at about 60% and infidelity by women at about 40%, with women catching up to the infidelity rate of men.\n\nSo why do you think women, who typically complain than men are afraid of comittment, seem to want divorce two to three times more than do men?\n\nIt seems to me that men are more comitted to marriage than women.  Comments? Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job ""isn't enough"" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he ""made that commitment"" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were ""liberated"" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening!

53,"i need help having lucid dreams.? i really want to be conscious in my dreams, and i have tried techniques from a few websites, but none of them seem to help. most everyone i know has had at least one lucid dream. do i have a sleeping problem? how have you had lucid dreams? Lucid dreams give us the ability to control our own dreams and steer them toward the direction we want.  In the lucid state, we are more willing to confront threats and as a result, become more self confident. When we achieve lucidity, we can use it as a tool to improve our sports game, to rehearse a speech, to fulfill our fantasies, or to solve a problem in our waking life. In fact, some athletes utilize their lucid dreams to practice their tennis serve, golf stroke or bat swing. Even in our day to day life, we can use lucid dreams to ask  the boss for a raise, prepare for a first date, overcome phobias,  get over  writer's block, etc. The application of lucid dreams is limited only to your imagination.  Lucid dreams can help us visualize and rehearse the event in our minds before it actually occurs. \n\nBecause brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event, what you ""learn"" or ""practice"" in your lucid dream state can be seen as training and preparation for the real thing in the waking world.  Our neuronal patterns are already being conditioned.\n\nAt least half of all adults have had at least one lucid dream in their lifetime. Many have reported having lucid dreams without even trying. Often flying is associated with lucid dreams.  However with practice, lucid dreaming can be learned and can be achieved at  your will."

Berkelium is believed to be similar to the other members of the actinide series and to terbium, its homolog in the lanthanide series. It is found in group IIIb of the periodic table. The 10 isotopes of berkelium that are known are all radioactive; the element has not been found in the earth's crust. Berkelium-247, the most stable isotope (half-life about 1,400 years), is difficult to produce; berkelium-249 (half-life 314 days) is more easily produced in weighable quantities and is used in studies of berkelium chemistry. Berkelium metal exists in two crystal modifications (see allotropy) and is chemically reactive; the chloride, fluoride, sulfide, nitrate, sulfate, perchlorate, oxide, and dioxide have been produced. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element to be synthesized. It was discovered late in 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Stanley G. Thompson, and Albert Ghiorso, who produced it by bombarding americium-241 with alpha particles in the cyclotron of the Univ. of California at Berkeley. Weighable quantities of the pure element were first isolated by Thompson and B. B. Cunningham in 1958."

In currently applicable calender, we have to add 1 day (24 hrs) every 4 years, i.e difference of 6:30 hrs every year. Hence if you go by calender and watch, it does not rises and sets at same time. But, if you go by earths rotation, then on completion of one rotation, sun rises and sets as per fixed earth's rotation speed.\n\nIf you want further accuracy, eath's rotation speed is also reducing ( 1 sec in approx 100 years).\n\nSo you can deduce from above the accuracy level you want, to decide."

This can produce heat, damaging effects, or even severe injury depending on the strength and frequency of the EMFs.\n\nIons are very important to various physiological processes, same for electron transfer.  \n\nToo much heat damages cells.\n\nTime, distance, shielding and field intensity are important factors in limiting the damages.\n\nUnder certain circumstances EMF can slowly cook a person.\n\nThere are stories about Navy people using Target Acquisition (Fire Control) radars to cook seagulls in flight.\n\nNuclear radiation can affect the nuclei of atoms in addition to the effects for EMF.\n\nYes, EMF is a type of potentially harmful radiation.  Gamma rays and light are powerful varieties of EMF.\n\nEven weak or slow EMF at lower frequencies can sometimes produce headaches and disorientation.\n\nCows in pastures have been adversely affected from both overhead and underground power lines.\n\nDeath is possible.\n\nWe live in a sea of weak EMFs.  Strong exposures can occur from nearby antennas, especially those used for broadcasting or relaying communications via radio or microwave.\n\nThere are meters available for monitoring EMF intensities.\n\nThe ionosphere and ozone layers of the atmosphere protect us from damaging rays from space.\n\nTV cameras must be wrapped in aluminum foil in some bad EMF areas.\n\nI live in a mobile home, this affords some protection too.\n\nGenerally microwaves and other shorter, more powerful wavelengths are more damaging.\n\nSunburn is a form of EMF damage.

72,"What is the possibility of a software controlling the brain with electrical signals in 10-20 years time? According to Pfizer's website, the brain can be controlled by electrical signals. Also, everything we sense goes through the brain, so in a sense it is possible to have a sense of reality with electrical signals pounding the brain. A good example would be the Matrix which plugs in humans to get energy from them by putting them in a dream world. This is being done to a limited extent in vision research-People have had microelectrode arrays implanted on the surface of the visual cortex of the brain, connected to a video camera.  The signal from the video camera activates the visual cortex, and these people, many of who have no eyes at all, or totally destroyed optic nerves, are able to ""see"" simple objects.  Thus, it is a proven concept that electrical signal can feed in meaningful information, and that information can lead to behaviour changes.  For many years, simple electrodes have been used to elicit specific tastes, memories, musclular twitches, etc.  As to your specific question-in order to control people's behaviour..in other words to overcome their will and wishes, and make them do things, or think things, that the operator of the machine wishes, would require a very good understanding of what controls our actions, emotions, and thoughts.  It's very unlikely that we will be at that state in 10-20 years.  Perhaps in 50 years we will have a very basic understanding, and in 100 years a fairly good understanding.  At any rate, when we do understand that, then it would be a relatively simple step to control it electronically (since electronics is simpler than the brain, and would also be advancing over that 100 years)."

Edison is considered the most prolific inventor, holding 1,093 patents in his name. Some of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier patents (most famously the Light Bulb), and were actually works of his numerous employees. Edison was sometimes criticized for not sharing the credit, but it was understood by his experimenters that all work was the property of their employer. Nevertheless, Edison received patents worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

95,"What adaptations does a xerophyte have that makes it able to store water? I need this for school? Desert Plant Adaptations\nDesert plants have adapted to the extremes of heat and aridity by using both physical and behavioral mechanisms, much like desert animals.\n\nPlants that have adapted by altering their physical structure are called xerophytes. Xerophytes, such as cacti, usually have special means of storing and conserving water. They often have few or no leaves, which reduces transpiration.\n\nPhreatophytes are plants that have adapted to arid environments by growing extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at or near the water table.\n\nOther desert plants, using behavioral adaptations, have developed a lifestyle in conformance with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. These type of plants are usually (and inaccurately) referred to as perennials, plants that live for several years, and annuals, plants that live for only a season.\n\nDesert perennials often survive by remaining dormant during dry periods of the year, then springing to life when water becomes available.\n\nMost annual desert plants germinate only after heavy seasonal rain, then complete their reproductive cycle very quickly. They bloom prodigiously for a few weeks in the spring, accounting for most of the annual wildflower explosions of the deserts. Their heat- and drought-resistant seeds remain dormant in the soil until the next year's annual rains.\n\nXerophytes\nThe physical and behavioral adaptations of desert plants are as numerous and innovative as those of desert animals. Xerophytes, plants that have altered their physical structure to survive extreme heat and lack of water, are the largest group of such plants living in the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nEach of the four southwestern deserts offers habitats in which most xerophytic plants survive. But each is characterized by specific plants that seem to thrive there. The Great Basin Desert is noted for vast rolling stands of Sagebrush and Saltbush, while in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Trees, Creosote Bush, and Burroweed predominate. The Sonoran Desert is home to an incredible variety of succulents, including the giant Saguaro Cactus, as well as shrubs and trees like mesquite, Paloverde, and Ironwood. The Chihuahuan Desert is noted for mesquite ground cover and shrubby undergrowth, such as Yucca and Prickly Pear Cactus.\n\nCactus, xerophytic adaptations of the rose family, are among the most drought-resistant plants on the planet due to their absence of leaves, shallow root systems, ability to store water in their stems, spines for shade and waxy skin to seal in moisture. Cacti originated in the West Indies and migrated to many parts of the New World, populating the deserts of the Southwest with hundreds of varieties, such as the Beavertail Cactus and Jumping Cholla.\n\nCacti depend on chlorophyll in the outer tissue of their skin and stems to conduct photosynthesis for the manufacture of food. Spines protect the plant from animals, shade it from the sun and also collect moisture. Extensive shallow root systems are usually radial, allowing for the quick acquisition of large quantities of water when it rains. Because they store water in the core of both stems and roots, cacti are well-suited to dry climates and can survive years of drought on the water collected from a single rainfall.\n\nMany other desert trees and shrubs have also adapted by eliminating leaves -- replacing them with thorns, not spines -- or by greatly reducing leaf size to eliminate transpiration (loss of water to the air). Such plants also usually have smooth, green bark on stems and trunks serving to both produce food and seal in moisture.\n\nPhreatophytes\nPhreatophytes, like the mesquite tree, have adapted to desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems to draw water from deep underground near the water table. The mesquite's roots are considered the longest of any desert plant and have been recorded as long as 80 feet. Botanists do not agree on the exact c"

132,"Can you demonstrate that Newton's third law ? Can you demonstrate that Newton's third law is true by taking some examples from real life. Then, explain how Newton's third law applies in those situations. Cool, you have asked what is totally QUESTION NUMBER ONE in basic physics. It's an exciting question which many teachers secretly don't understand and so their students get this hazy idea and kind of go thru the motions. Here's a way to remember and understand through a kooky made-up story.\n\nWow, it is so basic, that it took a super-genius, I mean way smarter than Einstein, to figure it out. A good old farm boy, astrologer, magician & alchemist, religious fanatic, mathematician and all around kook. Yep. Sir Isaac Newton. You gotta wonder what kind of parents would name their kid ""Sir""\n\nWell we all know what a force is, it is a sort of push or pull -- think of it as something that changes or *tries to change* the motion of stuff.\n\nNewton first figured out that if you leave a thing alone, or if the pushes and pulls on it cancel out, then it will sit there like a lump. Like those drivers wearing hats, and like sit there after the light has already turned green two minutes ago.\n\nOr else a thing will keep moving in the same straight line direction and speed like those drivers wearing hats who go 40 mph on the expressway with their turn signal blinking on and on. This is known as ""THE HAT LAW"".\n\nAll was well until he noticed that things move faster in an amount equal to how much you bully them or push them around. Twice the force, twice the fasterness and fasterness (also known as acceleration). This is called the ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"".\n\nThen he discovered a fly in the ointment. His HAT and BULLY laws didn't really explain all that much. Something was gumming up this beautiful theory. We call it MASS and it is still an unknown mystery as to what it really is. So we vaguely call it the amount of stuff or matter in a thing.\n\nSo he found out that for a certain force the faster-isity (acceleration) is cut in half if you double the mass. The bully has to push twice as hard to fasterize two little kids. So he was like ""I'll just add that in, and all will be cool"". The ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"" and ""THE HAT LAW"" totally did it all. Wa ta da babee!\n\nBut then Newton had a road accident. He was gunning his Harley over London bridge at like 250 when a bug hit him in the mouth and knocked out one of his wooden teeth. He was all ""Why am I so in pain?"". And the bug as it squooshed said ""Help! I'm a bug!""\n\nSo spitting out the splinters of his wooden tooth and the splattered bug, he had this revelation. He realized that because he was moving so fast, and the bug slowed down so fast, that even a eentsy mass like a bug was like taking a hammer to his tooth.\n\nHe noticed that the force was equal to the mass of the bug times the speed of impact all happening in a brief moment. Since Newton spoke Latin (he was the love child of Joe Newton and an Italian governess) he wrote ""Fastus buggus ina momentum hurtus like crazy."" Today we call this ""momentum"". It is just ""mass times speed"" or ""force times a small moment of time"".\n\nAnd he realized that the bug smashed up his tooth, but also that the bug was squashed (like a bug) because they were trading the EXACT same amount of momentum. The force on the tooth by the bug in the moment of time was PRECISELY equal to the smacko-ing the tooth used to stop the bug dead.\n\nHe said ""Hey, like he broke my tooth, but I killed him soooo dead!"" He did the math and found that the force of the bug on the tooth was equal to the force of the tooth on the bug!\n\nNo way did the two equal forces cancel, after all, his tooth was hammered to splinters, and the bug was flattened. They were equal and opposite, but since one was on the tooth, and the other force was on the bug they did serious damage! Today we call this the ""HELP I'M A BUG"" law.\n\nNow our man 'Zack was all set. He wrote down his three laws:\n\nTHE HAT LAW (beeep! beeep! Move it Hat G"

Below is a description.\n\nSeeing Waste During a Kaizen Blitz\n\nProject team members may not be used to thinking in terms of waste and value in their individual work, their workgroup, and workstream so an emphasis on understanding the 7 types of waste in the project setting is essential. Examples of wastes within the work of a project team include:\n\nOverproduction due to unclear requirements from the upstream process, waiting time for information from another project team member before work can be completed, inventory of projects or project tasks that are in process, motion of switching from one multi-task activity to another, defects and rework loops, and transportation and the delays and loss of information caused by hand-offs.\n\nThen there is processing waste (which some call over-processing) Whenever you are using a crude tool to accomplish a task rather than the best available that may exist somewhere else in the workstream of the project, this is processing waste."

If you know the story ANY input would be great! I'm kind of lost, lol.\n\n1) Vivien Thomas (should/should not) have abandoned his scientific work at Johns Hopkins University to fulfill his dreams of attending college and medical school.    OR\n\n2) Had he earned a medical degree, Vivien Thomas (could/could not) have made even greater contributions to scientific research.\n\nWe are to pick a side (should/shouldn't or could/couldn't) and come up with 3 valid reasons why using facts from the movie about this story. The movie is called ""Something the Lord Made"". Vivien Thomas could not have have abandoned his scientific work at Johns Hopkins University to fulfill his dreams of attending college and medical school. But he should have.\n\n1. He deserved the opportunity to attend medical school. It was his dream. He did all the scientific work in the discovery of open heart surgery and had no credentials to support his findings. Therefore, he gave Dr. Blalock the opportunity to take credit for his accomplishments. But as it was previously mentioned, the time in which the event took place has to be taken in consideration. Even if he had finished medical school, it is possible that he would not have received the proper credit. He just wasted alot of time, and until recently had little to show for it. And furthermore, had he the opportunity to attain his medical degree, he could have the autonomy to develop his own research. \n\n2. One would be remiss in not mentioning the fact that Blalock's pride kept him from allowing this to happen. Blalock was well aware of the credentials that Thomas needed in order to have any credibility. And in the film Blalock's wife called this fact to his attention. Thomas was also aware that he was being short-changed. Thomas was in a position where he had to think about being able to provide for his family. But as long as they had been struggling on the poor salary that was he was being paid to work as a research assistant, he could have finished medical school twice. Thomas didn't realize that he was in a position of power. Blalock believed that he couldn't do his valuable work without Thomas. Thomas could have totally made his participation in the study contingent on the funding of his studies.\n\n3. In the event that he decided that he didn't want to work on Blalock's study, he would still have a professional degree to fall back on. And I believe that Thomas realized that. If he decided to leave the study he would have to work as a janitor or handyman, and he had specialized training as a surgeon. It would have been humiliating. And that fact gave Blalock the advantage, because even though Thomas wasn't a physician, he still had the prestige of being a part of history."

You will probably need more than one professional to help you with this, depending on the severity of your child's problem. My daughter's problem was quite severe, and we found that we needed both a psychologist for therapy, and a medical specialist who could prescribe meds (because most psychologists cannot). We had recommendations from other physicians, as well as from friends who had also been through it. Even the Yellow Pages may have listings that mention an expertise with ADD or ADHD. You might also check with your insurance company, or even the counselor at your child's school. Whoever you choose, it's important to have someone your teen feels comfortable with, and who has plenty of experience in this area.  You probably already know this, but if not, or for someone else reading this, it's important to realize just how serious this disorder can be. Lack of attention span is just one small part of it, and ADHD can have a tremendous impact on the life of your teen, and that of your entire family.

I'm unclear as to your test. If you are referring to the urine microalbumin (normal ratio of microalbumin to creatinine is 0-30), then 66 mean that the kidney has started to spill protein. This is the earliest stage of diabetic kidney damage. If not already on it, Hubby should be started on an ACE inhibitor (enalapril, lisinopril, captopril, etc.). These meds have been proven to delay/prevent further kidney damage. Of course, good control is always essential."

How would a person go about doing it and what legal rights should this person have over the other, like husband and wife. ""The symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, while not normally associated with a substantial loss of the capacity to reason, can include brief periods of parapsychotic behaviors, while the rageful impulsivity associated with the disorder can also frequently escalate into episodes of physical violence. \n\nSituations can indeed arise with BPD that necessitate summoning police or emergency aid in order to protect the sufferer from the risk of ""causing harm to self or others"" (the standard legal clause in most US states underwriting involuntary commitment).""\n\nBaker Acting comes from ""Florida's Baker Act which was the first US State Law passed to ensure a legal foundation for commitment to psychiatric care regardless of the desires of the person with mental illness, and since its enactment, others such as New York's 'Kendra's Law' have followed suit.

When Allison got back from a nearby town partying for her birthday (she's 16), her mom took her to the gynecologist to see if she'd has $ex.  She hadn't.\nBut my question is, how does a gynecologist tell if you've had $ex before?  If I've stuck something into my vagina once (I'm young, experimental, etc - don't judge me!), ten would it look as though I've had $ex?\n\nHonestly, I'm being serious and truthful, please help me by answering! A doctor cannot tell whether you are a virgin or not. What a doctor can tell is whether your hymen has been broken or not. A female can break her hymen in many different ways, such as horseback riding. Also, some hymens have a large enough opening to accommodate a penis during sex so that the hymen does not tear. If you are concerned about a doctor inferring that a torn hymen means you are having sex, do not worry. It is not the doctor's position to make any assumptions about you, even though he or she might ask you questions regarding your sexual activity. For your best interest, you should answer your doctor truthfully. Your doctor can better care for you if he or she knows all of your medical history, including whether you are sexually active or not. In addition, doctors have a bond of patient confidentiality with their clients, so a doctor cannot tell your parents if you are sexually active if you do not ask him or her to tell them. \n\nhttp://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/print.php?article=faq&refid=310\n\nIt is very difficult to know if a woman is still a virgin, even if there is tightness as a doctor examines her. There are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. For example, a woman's vagina may be tight because she is nervous while being examined by the doctor, or then again, her muscles may be relaxed and she may never have experienced intercourse before. A woman may also not have a hymen, and never had one, so this would not indicate her state of ""virginity"". The best way to know if a woman has had penile penetration still remains to ask her. Most doctors will also ask their female patients if they have had sex before, when they are about to make a gynecological examination for the first time. \n\nhttp://ideas.uqam.ca/~dsexo/english/9906e/qa0384-1518m.htm"

DSL is also around 3 megs, and they are both the same. The difference? Users. Cable is based on how many people use it. The more you have, the faster it is. Talk to people in your neighborhood. If you get mostly cable users, use cable. DSL is more reliable if most don't have cable. They are both fast, but cable will be faster MORE often than DSL,, but keep in mind DSL's variations are smaller than Cable, because somedays cable can be Dial up slow, but others T1 fast.\n\nAlso, Cable is only available is 3 megs, and is expensive. YOu can get 3 levels of DSL, lite (256 Kbps) regular (1400 Kbps) and high speed (3000 Kbps or 3 megs). If you don't need the fastest, DSL is the best choice because it is more cost effective.

226,"Slow media player? I have a fast, high spec computer, and everything else is running great and fast, but when I try to play movie clips of any kind, they take an age to start, around 30 - 45 secs sometimes. Very occasionally, about once every 10 clips, one will start straight away. Its not a copyright issue, as it does it with any free to download clips from the wen. Its not just windows media player, same happens if I try to open them in real player or similar. I have the latest versions of all software. Any suggestions? the download is the key. if it happens when you  are watching streaming video (straight off the net) then its most likely to be a connection lag. this is where the download stream is not quick enough for the playing stream and it will pause to wait for more of the video to download before it tries to play it.\n\nonly option for that is to wait until it is fully downloaded before trying to play it, simply push the pause button until it no longer says ""buffering""\n\nif its not downloaded video check that you have all the relelvant codecs installed as it may be searching the internet for them before attempting to play them. it also uses the first ones it can grab hold of instaed of finding an exact match.\n\nto test this theory find a programme called ""gspot"" and open it and point it to the video you are trying to play. this will tell you what the codec is and wether you have it on your system\n\nNOTE: this will only work for files already on your system, not streaming files"
227,"Why is there a ""Links"" folder in my IE Favorites that I cannot delete?!? It's been driving my bonkers cuz the stupid folder is empty and I didn't put it there. I delete it, but when I log back on, it's there again! The same keeps happening with my Internet Explorer at home. What up wit dat? Well, before I get started on your question, I should tell you that Mozilla Firefox is a much better browser than Internet Explorer (IE). Firefox is safer, has tabbed browsing (which allows you to open multiple webpages in one window), and has many other convenient features. Click on the link near the bottom of this answer.\n\nNow on to IE: in order to eliminate the ""Links"" folder for good, copy and paste this link (http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm) into your IE browser window, scroll down to line 93, and then in the right column you should see ""Remove Links folder from IE/favorites."" Now, right-click on this link and click ""Save Target As."" Save this file to your desktop, minimize all your windows, double-click on the .reg file which you just saved to your desktop, follow any instructions which it may give to you (I do not, however, believe that it will ask you anything), and you should be all set! \n\nIf this doesn't work, check out http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_favorites.htm, and find ""Removing the links folder.""\n\nI hope this helps, and here is the Mozilla Firefox link:\n\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/firefox/"

229,"Whats good about Mac OS X? Whats good about Mac OS X?I never used Mac OS X and I want to know why people use it, like what Mac OS X got that Windows(HP) dont got!! Mac OS X is such a stable OS for one. Compare it to WinXP and there are dozens of good things. First of all Apple computers do not have DOS. No applications use other applications to work well on Macs. If you want to delete a program on a Mac, you just delete it. No worry about it taking a part of another program with it. Each application is a stand alone program. Usually, DOS is the base for viruses, worms etc. Since Macs have no DOS, they don't get any of the viruses that PC's do. You don't need spyware; anti virus; tracking bug software to keep your computer safe and clean. It comes to you that way and it stays that way.\n Most Mac applications are extremely simple to use, even for the first time user. The stability of the Apple Computers is solid. Plus they are sure a lot of fun to operate. It's very hard to compare OS X 10.4 to MS XP as they are as different as apples and oranges. They both are computers and that is where the similaries end."
230,"Are there ways to tell if/when your hard drive is gonna go? Bad sectors will appear if a drive is constantly rewriting the same place over and over again, such as on a badly fragmented partition.  Bad sectors appearing more often than every four months is a sign to start backing up data.  \n\nWhen in doubt, buy a new drive.  If you can live with a small size (20GB or less) you can find unused ones on the cheap to put into old PCs.  If you buy two and use them as a slave for data and master for programs, it's easy to replace in the future.\n\nIf you buy a new and larger drive, partition it with programs on one partition and data on another (say, 30/30 on a 60GB drive).  It will make tracking sector errors easier down the road."

237,"How can I fix this USB problem? The USB ports on my friend's Dell laptop don't work.  In other words, when I plug in USB devices, like flash drives, they don't function.  (The light on my USB SD card reader doesn't light up, for example.)  I already deleted the drivers and let the computer reinstall them through Plug-and-Play.  The computer recognized the hardware and installed drivers, indicating that it knows the USB device is there, but it still doesn't work.  What else can be done to fix this problem? Hi Doc...\n\nWell, if you followed the steps I gave you last time you asked this, then the problem is probably hardware-related. To find out for sure, get a voltmeter, set it to DC volts. \nThe USB interface consists of 4 pins. The two outside pins supply power to the device, and the inside pins are for data. Polarity need not be observed if you are using a digital voltmeter. With the computer booted up and running in Windows, put one lead of the voltmeter on one outside pin of a USB port, and the other lead on the other outside pin. If the meter reads 5 volts (regardless of polarity), then the USB ports are getting power, and the USB hub has probably failed. This problem is a depot-level problem, and only a warranty replacement or costly service will fix it. However... If the voltmeter reads zero, then your 5volt power connector inside the laptop case has probably disconnected. If the machine is within warranty, by all means take advantage. If not, then disassembly will be required. If your next Yahoo Question is ""How do you take apart a Dell Laptop"" then I will assume that your USB ports failed the voltage check, and I'll go into the disassembly procedures there."

The album has progressed slowly for a number of reasons, but perhaps chiefly because of Amy Lee's desire to allow the creative process to fully take its course and not rush production. Besides that, other distractions have included other band members' side projects, health problems concerning guitarist Terry Balsamo and the controversy revolving around the dismissal of their former manager. Lee stated on EvBoard that Evanescence's new album will be wrapping up in March 2006. It should be on store shelves in late summer, with the tentative release date rumored to be August 22nd. However, recently the wife of Rocky Gray (the band's drummer) has posted news on another fan board, stating that the release will be pushed back to sometime in September, allegedly because ""Wind-Up [the band's current record label] wants to make a few changes to the upcoming single.""\n\n\nAfter a long period of stasis, the Evanescence website was updated with a short piece of news.

269,"Who has seen ""An American Haunting"" and how was it? I was also at the screening at the Arclight theaters and I have to say how bad it really was. It was trying so hard to be the next great American horror film. The music was so redundant and overdone. And yes there were little girls with long black hair AGAIN in some scenes. The POV of the spirit is the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's also very redundant. The whole dream/nightmare/memory thing...whatever it was...felt so unnecessary and redundant. There's so much redundancy and boredom to this film. The only reason why I jumped at some parts and many times why I do this in horror movies is because of the loud music. Who doesn't jump at sudden bursts of trumpet sounds? And Rachel-Hurd Wood was not that great either. She was much more believable in Peter Pan. She needed a rougher edge to her character and I think her innocence in real life bleeds through too much in her character. There was also a very awkward scene where she does the whole ""twitching-I'm possessed-help me"" act and the family is just staring and edited in a way that makes them look so careless. I couldn't help but laugh. Her whole twitching thing looked so fake as well. For some reason that moment totally made me picture the director shouting out his commands ""scream! shake harder..HARDER!!"" And Donald Sutherland can not act in this as well. And Sissy Spacek I feel like just wants money. She hasn't been in anything good since In the Bedroom. Story's pretty weird. For devil's sake....it's the same director as Dungeons and Dragons. He was ranting on to a select few of us outside the theater of the plot points and why people did this and that. No one can possibly know that the first viewing. Ok..enough of my ranting. I think with a lot of smart editing, and different choices of music placing, this film can be somewhat good."

The town is never mentioned in the movie, only in the books it is mentioned that she lives near Butterfield. However, Butterfield does not exist. In some publicity material Baum had for his 1904-05 comic page, Dorothy writes a letter to her old friends and the address given is ""Uncle Henry's Farm Near Topeka."" In the book Return to Oz, Dorthy lives outside Franklin, which does exist. There is a tourist attraction in Liberal, Kansas that called Dorothy's house, which is a relocated farmhouse built in 1907, along with the original model of the house used in the film and a collection of memorabilia. Hope this helps, although there is no real answer"

Well, first find out what kind of wood your cheapy guitar is.Then if you look it up and its basswood, or something decent, change some stuff around. Better tuners are always nice, nothing sucks more then bad tuners going out when your playing. I dont honestly think the nut is gonna help unless its seriously ruined. Pickups are nice, but none of this even matters if your using cheap cables, and a cheap amp too. Everything has to be good quality or theres really no point in adding to your guitar.I mean if you get let say a pair of emgs put in, they would normally be great mid-high range guitar tones, but if your amp doesnt have good distortion and sounds grainy, well your upgrade is only doing half of what it should.The cheapest thing on my list is cables-bad cables suck tone.You could also get a nice lil graphic eq, they can help a lot for a lil money."

308,"Whats the deal with credit for a person new to the states? I'll be moving to the states from England to live with my husband and was wondering if anyone knew what credit will be like for me? I know that my credit history will not be passed from England but it I'm wondering how hard it will be for me to apply for bank accounts, credit cards etc etc. Thanks My cousins are coming from overseas and imigrating to the U.S. So I have a general idea. It's very difficult for them right now to get credit cards due to their lack of any credit history. The only ones available are either bank cards that they open an account with, or other credit card companies that will give them a small credit line and require annual fees.\n\nTo quickly build credit, I would recommend opening a bank account of course, start paying some sort of bills (utlities) quickly to get a record of on-time payments. You will quickly establish a history and your credit situation will improve. I hope that helps!\n\nGood luck!\n\n**EDIT:\n\nI just noticed you said you were moving to the U.S. to join your husband. If he already has credit, then you might want to also consider opening joint credit cards with his name on the card. This will also help you establish credit without having to start from the ground up. You'll get a ""boost"" from his credit."

311,"what are the merits and demerits of population? I need a detailed answer ,b coz its for my projects Obviously, there is a minimum population beyond which there are simply not enough people to make up a functioning country.  Beyond that, there needs to be enough people to have a fully functional economy.  That is, the major professions and trades must be adequately represented, as well as entrepreneurs and investors, support staff and other service workers, etc.  \n\nOnce there are enough to run the country, you start to see the disadvantages of too much population:  pressure on natural resources and infrastructure, housing and job scarcity, crowding causing delays in transportation, retail trade, etc.  Overpopulation also means a higher percentage of non-productive consumers than the system can most efficiently accommodate.  This causes pressure to create bureaucracy to control the excess population, including the increased crime rate caused by crowding.\n\nI do not know of any studies of what the optimum population is for a given type of geography under a given level of developments, etc., but most of the ""civilized"" world is overcrowded rather than too sparsely populated.  The only exceptions, like Canada, tend to be those in rather extremes of physical conditions.\n\nEnough to get you started?"

329,"what are virus? In computer security technology, a virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. A computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of a virus into the program is termed as an infection, and the infected file (or executable code that is not part of a file) is called a host. \n\nIn the context of computer software, a Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software. The term is derived from the classical myth of the Trojan horse. In the siege of Troy, the Greeks left a large wooden horse outside the city. The Trojans were convinced that it was a gift, and moved the horse to a place within the city walls. It turned out that the horse was hollow, containing Greek soldiers who opened the city gates of Troy at night, making it possible for the Greek army to pillage the city. Trojan horse programs work in a similar way: they may look useful or interesting (or at the very least harmless) to an unsuspecting user, but are actually harmful when executed.\n\nA computer worm is a self-replicating computer program, similar to a computer virus. A virus attaches itself to, and becomes part of, another executable program; however, a worm is self-contained and does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_virus"

I used to pay my bills on time, however, in 2002 I was diagnosed with a disabling illness and fell way behind on my bills. I no longer am able to work and have been on Social Security Disability Insurance for 6 months now.

In Oregon and the Netherlands, there is this thing called ""Assisted Suicide"". In those 2 places, the person has this choice to ask a doctor for a pill.

356,"do you think bush and blair should face war crimes charges against them? for the war on iraq which had nothing to do with terrorism, but for the iraqi oil. From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi"

360,"What is the passing score on the asvab to be consider in the NAVY special forces team? The ASVAB is device used by the military to determine where your talents might be best utilized. I personally believe that talent cannot be measured but that's just me. As a former Navy type, I can tell you that after boot camp you will probably be offered the opportunity to try to qualify for consideration for BUDS training. In the early 80's, at NAS Millington A school, you signed up to attend a tryout for BUDS, we marched over to the base swimming pool and were promptly half drowned by a group of very zealous Seals. This is just a preliminary to see if;\n1.       You can swim\n2.       If you panic\n3.       How much heart you have.\n\nIt does not qualify you for anything, other than a second look.\nBUDS candidates are a fairly select group of people, gleened from a much larger school of tadpoles, but even they get thinned out significantly. As a group these guys, contrary to movies, already tend to be highly intelligent though (this is not determined by an ASVAB but by a process) and have an incredible amount of perserverance, guts and determination. The process is designed to weed out those that think like individuals, don't take direction exactly (also what bootcamp does), and can reach into thier gut and find strength when they don't have the steam for more abuse. This is only BUDS, these folks are not neccesarily SEALS, From my point of view, these folks are more than remarkable, my hat is off to them.\n\nIf this is something your looking at doing, the entire military, and the Navy especially (Don't let a jarhead, air force puke, grunt, or a beach comber Coastie tell you different.), is a good life and offers opportunities you can't get anywhere else on the planet. I wish you success in your endeavor."

375,"Could anyone (Preferably a law maker) explain why congress cuts spending from every where but from themselves? Congress's last serious attempt to reduce wasteful spending occurred in 1995 and 1996, when the 104th Congress terminated several programs whose irrelevance was proven by how quickly they were forgotten. But Congress then committed several strategic errors, such as overreaching and shutting down the federal government in 1995. After President Bill Clinton deftly exploited theses mistakes, budget cutters overreacted to Clinton's tactics by completely abandoning the mission of smaller government. Federal spending subsequently skyrocketed as a paralyzed Congress decided that budget confrontations with the Clinton White House could never be won and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nIn 2003, reducing wasteful spending is more important than ever. Defense, homeland security, and expensive entitlements are stretching the federal government thin while a high tax burden is weighing down the economy. Yet, although President Clinton is no longer in office and budget-cutting strategies have improved, Congress and (albeit to a lesser extent) President Bush still maintain a reflexive fear of attacking wasteful spending.\n\nIt is time to step back and think about the role of government, the obligations of the private sector, and the delineation between federal and state responsibilities."

Anyway from what I understand, the land that is now Israel was not viewed as the ""promised land"" by Jews, it was a place to live and heal after the holocaust.

One side says that its wrong to just give way food, that the poor must work for it, the government has no buisness funding programs.\n\nOn a global scale it is much more complicated. and population is not the reason it can not be solved.\nMajor reasons include.\n\n*unstable governments in the poorest nations.\nWaring nations.\n*Lack of Prioritization of the problem by stable rich nations.\n*Lack of Funding to distrubute food, lack of storage facilities.\n*Lack of evironmental regulations..(rivers and oceans, ect ect)\n\nBut if you want the simplest answer...is that mankind is flawed. They nation before humanity, they see borders before need. They say there is no solution so they do not try.\nIs there a soultion to that....I am not sure."

396,"How is Guantanamo a U.S. Territory but it's in Cuba?  What is the history behind that? Guantánamo Bay (Spanish: Bahía de Guantánamo) is a bay located in Guantánamo Province at the south-eastern end of Cuba (19°54′N 75°9′W).\n\nThe southern portion of the bay is surrounded by the United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, a naval base established in 1898. Recently, the base has begun to host a detainment camp for militant combatants collected from both Afghanistan and Iraq. The Guantanamo Bay detainment camp—in fact, even the U.S. presence in Guantánamo—is against the will of the Cuban government and considered to be an illegal occupation of the area. The Cuban government strongly denounces the treaty on grounds that it violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. However, this article declares a treaty void only if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of international law (see below). While the United States may have applied political pressure to Cuba in 1903, there was no use of force or the threat of its use.\n\nThe bay was originally named Guantánamo by the Taino. Christopher Columbus landed at the location known as Fisherman's Point in 1494. The bay was briefly renamed Cumberland when the British took it in the first part of the 18th century during the War of Jenkins' Ear. In 1790 the British garrison at Cumberland died of fever as had a previous British force, before they could attack Santiago by land.\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War the U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Thus Guantánamo with its excellent harbor was chosen for this purpose. The Marines landed successfully with naval support; however, as they went inland Spanish resistance increased to the point at which Cuban scouts were needed to save the United States Marines.\n\nThe US Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, sometimes called ""GTMO"" or ""Gitmo"", covers 116 km² (about 45 square miles) on the western and eastern banks of the bay. It was established in 1898, when the United States obtained control of Cuba from Spain at the end of the Spanish-American War, following the 1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay. The U.S. government obtained a perpetual lease that began on February 23, 1903, from Tomás Estrada Palma, an American citizen, who became the first President of Cuba. The newly formed American protectorate incorporated the Platt Amendment in the Cuban Constitution. The Cuban-American Treaty held, among other things, that the United States, for the purposes of operating coaling and naval stations, has ""complete jurisdiction and control"" of the Guantánamo Bay, while the Republic of Cuba is recognized to retain ultimate sovereignty"

398,"Bloodlines through immigration? If through immigration and interracial marrages you found that you had ""native American"" blood but also found that the ""nation/tribe"" that you are claiming to be from did not recognize you because your bloodline was to diluted, would you still claim to be ""Native american"" or even part? Well, this is kind of an issue with some tribes.  The BIA has made rules about who can be recognized, usually you have to have at least 25% blood to be a tribe member.  Some people who are say, half Arapaho and half Cherokee or something have to choose WHICH tribe they can claim to be.  Tribes which would traditionally adopt members are not allowed to do so.  \n\nWhat that boils down to is that legally, unless you're a quarter whatever, you can't claim to be any tribe.  But I would say you could point out that you have part of that bloodline, and be proud that you can trace your heritage.\n\nOh, and a lot of us ""Irish"" in the states say that because we've only been here three or four generations and tend to marry other Irish families.

There are certainly atheist materialists that have tried to say that the only logical conclusion of evolution is atheism, but they are fools and liars, one and all.  The fact is that the tehory of evolution by natural selection is a) scientifically founded and b) not at odds with a belief in God.\n\nIf you don't agree with eveolution being taught, then quite frankly, you don't agree with the idea of teaching science at all.

I cannot manipulate the theory of creationism to create a vaccine, the way I can manipulate evolution.  School is not about some sort of all-out investigation into Divine Truth; it is meant to be practical.  And like it or not, the theory of evolution by natural selection has practical applications.  We do not teach how to use the ALTAIR computer, because it's pointless; not because the functioning of it is any ""less true"" than the modern PC.  We do not teach basket weaving or bricklaying in school, because they have very little usefulness.  But every person who ever takes antibiotics or who ever uses a disinfectant on the kitchen counter can learn something useful about the nature of evolution.

Randomness in variation is only a part of the picture, and you ideologues have decided to cling to that part of the theory and ignore the rest--especially ignoring the vast amount of biochemical support for the theory, none of which could have been known to Darwin--in order to distort the case for the theory, which is very, very strong.\n\nDo you realize how long a billion years really is?

It's all random, Brownian motion that allows ions to diffuse in and out of the channels, that makes the gates open and close, that makes the synaptobrevin and synatotagmin and SNAP-25 proteins collide and fuse the cells membranes to spill the neurotransmitter into the cleft where it will randomly bump around the synapse and then randomly bind to a post-synaptic receptor, all before randomly bouncing around until it hits the reuptake proteins that will sequester the neurotransmitter.

God says that he is a merciful God. To answer your question I would say ""NO"". God knows there are people out there who haven't heard of him. God sees every human's heart and mind and knows what kind of person they are. God reserves judgment unto himself. But another question is--what is hell? The Greek word Hades referrs to a hole in the ground where all man goes when he dies. The burning hell you are referring to is the Lake of Fire where those who have received God's judgment go. All mankind have to stand before God Almighty when it's their time. God opens the book of life and the rewards He has written in there are given to the people whose names are written in His book."

Juda realized that Jesus was who He said He was in the garden, that is why he hung himself."

No offense, but you kind of got yourself into this situation when you agreed to start seeing him, didn't you?  Or was it a case of you were not told about the boyfriend before hand?  In that case- I think you should drop him like a hot potato.  He's being an ass and you definitely deserve better than that.  You should never, ever have to put yourself in the position of being the ""bit on the side.""  Find someone who will treat you right!  As for why all men are bast*rds...

441,"Is there really ghosts or spirits  among us? As a child the chandelier used to swing from side to side, and the radio would turn on by itself in the middle of the night.\n\nOne time on a camping trip I was walking back from the bathrooms at that moment right between day and night and I saw someone walk across the front of the site and stop behind a tree. So I figure one of the people is going to jump out and try to surprise me, so I pull out my flashlight, walk up to the tree, turn on the light, and there's no one there.\n\nOne time I was alone in a house, and I felt a presence. I looked at a mobile hanging motionless, and said, ""If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin."" The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero. After my niece was born, she would look up at areas where no one was standing, and laugh and giggle. We all knew that she was looking at gramma, so we never showed her any pictures. Finally, at about a year old, she could speak, and my sister showed her the family photo album. My niece picked out her photo and said, ""That's Old Gramma."""

445,"Is Christianity All that Folks Say it is? I am a follower of an eastern religion and have made some unsettling observations:\n1) Every Christian I have met is less intelligent than myself\n2) Every Christian I have met is ignorant of their own faith\n3) Every Christian I have met is a jerk who slanders peoples of other faiths and cares only for those who share their own beliefs\n4) Christians are responsible for all the wrongs in the world, as they have done nothing to right them\n5) Christians place blame on others, ignoring their own foolishness, saying that others are more foolish than themselves\n6) Christians believe in a man who died for their sins 2000 years ago only because a book tells them to do so! How idiotic?? ! Who believes the printed word with no evidence in the real world???\n\nAre these not valid points? Are Christians not leading wasting lives??? Those aren't valid points, and I'm not wasting my life, I'm living it for the creator of you and me. I think that you might wanna start seeing that.\n\n1. Intelligence is subjective. People who are mentally handicapped can be capable of things that we cannot explain, and people who are smart can have no common sense.\n\n2. If you mean ""ignorant,"" then of course we are! It takes a lot of work to memorize the 66 books of the Bible, and people don't have enough time today to recite them word for word. If you mean completely oblivious, then you're dead wrong. All Christians have had Jesus come into their heart and that's the biggest part. The rest is doctrine, theology, and adhering to the Bible.\n\n3. I'm not a jerk, and I haven't slandered you. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be taking the time to write all of this.\n\n4. Lottie Moon was a missionary to China. She shared her faith with the people there, and empathized with them so much. She eventually was so weak from sharing her food with them and having little to herself that she wasn't strong enough for the journey back to the U.S. on a ship and she died. This is only one of many examples, but that would take a book to write.\n\n5.Well, aren't you placing blame on Christians? You are proving that you are no better than we are. Show me a completely wise person (Christian or not), and I'll show you that I can fly by flapping my arms.\n\n6.It's history, it's not just a book. It's inspired by God, and I try to live by it. There are many writings besides the books in the Bible that support this argument. Since the time of the book of Genesis, there have been Jews. Christianity is the fulfillment (or a continuation) of that faith. It dates back further than 2000 years ago. Jesus' birth was predicted.\nTruth is: nobody educated denies that Jesus existed, but there are those who don't believe he's the Son of God.\nTake a look at the prophecies of the Old Testament (basically the Jewish Bible) and see how Jesus hasn't gone against any of those prophecies.\n\nIf you just wanted a simple answer, then sorry. I only give those to questions which require a simple answer (or the really stupid questions like ""how are you feeling today?"" or ""why is the alarm clock beeping at me?"")"

467,"Who should the 49ers draft in the 1st round of the 2006 NFL draft? I would like to hear who you think, and why? If you think they should trade, what should the trade be? Keep in mind they have both the 6th pick and the 22nd pick From everything ive been reading the 49ers have two players that are their top picks, AJ Hawk from The Ohio State and Mario Williams NC State.  There have also been reports that their reasoning for trading theit  second and third round picks with Denver was to position themselves to move up to the top 3, the thinking would be that Williams and Hawk will both be gone at 6.  But for the question asked I'll assume they stay put.\n\nFor the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff.  Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick, but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers. \n\nAs for the 22nd pick, it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them.  Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson, but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect."

483,"i want know more for cf barcelona? In the late 1800's Hans Gamper and ten other enthusiasts were playing an unknown sport called 'foot-ball'. When Gamper went on to found Barcelona Football Club on 29 November 1899, he could hardly have imagined the momentous events that would follow!\n\nThroughout some of Catalonia's most difficult years, the flag represented the people's hopes for freedom, and today that very flag is the symbolic link which continues to represent the ties between a very special club and its' supporters.\n\nOver the course of 100 years, the club has lived through moments of glory and tragedy, through good times and bad, through epic victories and crushing defeats. Each one of these moments has contributed to shaping Barcelona into the absolutely unique club that it is today.\n\nBarcelona's renown can be attributed, in part, to impressive statistics but another factor is certainly that Barcelona is one of the most highly decorated teams in the world. With the exception of the International Cup, the showcases of the Barcelona museum contain every trophy possible. Topping off the impressive collection is the European Cup, the crowning glory of a Wembley final that went into the history books.\n\nQuite apart from winning the supreme continental prize, Barcelona is also in the extremely enviable position of being the only team in Europe to have participated in every European Cup since 1955 the first year the tournament began. Their massive European trophy collection also includes the Cup Winners' Cup, which the club has won no less than four times - making it undisputed king. In addition, Barca accumulated three Fairs Cups (nowadays know as the UEFA Cup) in the 1958, 1960 and 1966 seasons. The Club retained the trophy in perpetuity after winning a special final in 1971, which paired together the first winner of the competition, FC Barcelona, against the last winner, Leeds United. However, Barca does not just reign in Europe but also in Spain, specifically in the Kings Cup, leading the ranking of winners in this competition with 24 titles. \n\nOf course, Barcelona reigns in Spain as well as in Europe and no other Spanish team can equal Barcelona's 24 championship titles in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the Spanish championship league (historically one of the toughest competition grounds for the club), Barcelona celebrates the centenary birthday with 16 league titles to its name. Six of these were amassed over the last ten years alone.\nBut most outstanding of all was that glorious night of May 20, 1992 at the legendary Wembley Stadium in London, when Barcelona beat Sampdoria 1-0 to win the European Cup. Ronald Koemans goal in the 112th-minute of the game now forms part of the Blaugrana legend and the side that featured in that historic match has gone down in gold letters in the clubs proud history: Zubizarreta, Nando, Ferrer, Koeman, Juan Carlos, Bakero, Salinas (Goikoetxea), Stoichkov, Laudrup, Guardiola (Alexanko) and Eusebio.\n\nThe last few years\n\nThe Cup Winners Cup, Spanish Cup and Spanish Super Cup won by English manager Bobby Robson's Barca in 96-97, the League and Cup double in 1998, and the League in 1998-99 (the first of Van Gaal's two periods in charge at the club) were the last major titles to be won by the FC Barcelona first team.\n\nAnother highly emotional occasion was the Club Centenary in 1999 (Antoni Tàpies designed the official poster), which served as a link between a glorious past and hope for continued success in the future. In its historic centenary year, Barcelona won the football, basketball, handball, and roller hockey leagues.\n\nOn July 23, 2000, Joan Gaspart took over the presidency of the club, and on January 22, 2002, work began on the 'Joan Gamper' training grounds in Sant Joan Despí. Another of the Club's proudest moments came on May 11, 2003, when the basketball team won the Euroleague for the first time ever. The final was played in the Palau Sant Jordi aga"

He pitched very well in the World Series, and he deserves credit for that. But let's not forget that he was so bad with the Angels early in the season that they designated him for assignment. Weaver is a free agent, and he will command a big salary because there are few pitchers available on the market. IMO, whoever signs Weaver will regret it.
