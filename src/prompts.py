CLASSIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the document's PRIMARY purpose and meaning in relation to: {instruction}
2. If ANY existing cluster reasonably captures this document's essence, USE IT (exact match required)
3. Only if NO existing cluster fits, create a NEW descriptive label that:
   - Is 1-3 words maximum
   - Directly relates to the clustering objective
   - Captures the document's main intent/category
4. Consider semantic similarity, not just keyword matching

RESPONSE FORMAT: Return only the cluster label (no quotes, explanations, or additional text)

TASK: Review these cluster labels for consistency and clarity. Suggest better names if needed.
Rules:
1. Labels should be concise (1-3 words)
2. Labels should clearly reflect the clustering objective
3. Avoid redundant or overly similar labels
4. Use clear, descriptive terms
